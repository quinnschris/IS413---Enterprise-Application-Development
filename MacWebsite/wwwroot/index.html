    <h3>What I hope to get out of IS 413?</h3>
    <p>From 413 I hope to be able to get a better understanding of programming.
        Since I have taken CS 142, I have some experience with C languages, and hope
        to become familiar with what they are capable of. Along the same lines, I believe
        this class will help expand my abililty to comprehend what I am capable of personally
        programming. My experience with programming is limited to the things learned in the IS
        program, but I hope to expand my knowledge to become a better asset in industry. </p>
